# Spyfall
Created: 2022-05-08 17:05  

Everyone knows what the secret location is except for the spy. Players want to find out who the spy is while the spy wants to know the location. To do this, players ask questions to each other. The idea is to be vague so that the spy canâ€™t figure it out but not too vague or else people might think you are the spy. Really simple and funny game but also incredibly tense and stressful for the spy.
