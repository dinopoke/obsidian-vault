# A Fake Artist Goes To New York
Created: 2022-05-08 17:11  

Like Spyfall but with drawing. Everyone knows what the subject is except for the fake artist and they all take turns drawing a stroke on a collective drawing while they try and guess who has no idea what they are drawing. Comes in a small pink box thatâ€™s full of colorful markers.
