# One Night Werewolf
Created: 2022-05-08 17:10  

It’s Werewolf/Mafia but in one round and there’s no moderator. Lots of different roles so it’s all about trying to figure out who everyone is by piecing together what they did in the night time phase. Lots of yelling and accusing and of course, lying. Rounds are super quick and addictive. Can be combined with other versions like Daybreak, Vampire and Alien for even more roles.
