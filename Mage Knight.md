# Mage Knight
Created: 2022-05-08 17:03  

A really long and complicated game where it’s best played solo. Fantasy game where you explore the world, fight enemies, build an army and take over cities. Lots of figuring out what to do based on what you have in your hand and being able to pull off complex combos. Has been compared to [[Skyrim]] but I think it’s quite different. That said it does feel like an epic adventure.
