Created: 2022-06-22 12:06  

- weird hobbies
- Producer is a jack of all trades, swiss army knife
- speak with competence to various disciplines
- babel fish of the team - translator
- know when to step back - value their expertise
- simple communication
- verbal, non verbal acknowledgement
- reserve judgement
- don't jump towards conclusions before they finish speaking
- art - be on model
- engineering - optimize for the long term
- design - user experience and intent
- ea used to have producers be designers - slowly moving away now. 
- secret to good producer - learning how to constantly nag people but not annoy them
- leadership is about setting standards so you can overachieve
- distribute the credit, take the blame
- decisions don't get made in meetings, consensus does - decisions are made by someone
- producers pitch up the chain and down the chain
- street cred, data and narrative
- understand the priorities of the game and the capacity to do that
- thinking time and doing time NOT both
- never accept i won't know until I start
- collaborative space is not working space they need time to focus
- 15m to get into the zone
- a good producer is a force multiplier
