# Deception Murder in Hong Kong

Created: 2022-05-08 16:55  

A cross between [[Mysterium]] and [[Cluedo]]. The Forensic Investigator know who the murderer is as well as the weapon and evidence but they canâ€™t say anything. Instead they point to word clues on tiles to help the team figure it out while the murderer tries to hide their identity and feed the team misinformation. Really easy to learn and lots of fun in large groups.
