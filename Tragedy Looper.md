# Tragedy Looper
Created: 2022-05-08 17:11  

Itâ€™s like an anime where the protagonists are stuck in a time loop where a tragedy always keeps happening. The protagonists need to find out what it is and prevent it within a certain number of loops while the mastermind tries to keep one step ahead and throw them off the scent. Sounds familiar?
