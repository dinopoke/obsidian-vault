Created: 2022-06-02 00:10  

Items From The Video ðŸŒ±ðŸª´

Item 1: Tile for your keys (Stop losing your keys) 
Item 2: 0.7mm Felt-tip Pen (Helps develop competence for drawing) 
Item 3: Lock Box (Locks away phones/ other small items for a certain time period) 
Item 4: Snorkeling Gear (Overcoming a fear resulting in a new hobby which leads to a domino of fear overcoming) 
Item 5: Nag Champa (Incense slows down the rush of life and helps you relax) 
Item 6: Polaroid (The film cost and lack of volume of pictures make you value and take pictures with more effort as opposed to pictures taken on your phone) 
Item 7: Calm App (Meditation app recommended by the therapist. Even though Mindfulness is a cliche, getting over it and using the app is apparently effective.) 
Item 8: Yoga Mat (Apart from the obvious and using the mat for its benefits, even just seeing the mat, you are reminded to relax and take a break) 
Item 9: Chameleon Boardgame (The game acts as a social lubricant and takes over the purpose of alcohol to ease up a conversation with strangers) 
Item 10: Dog Tattoos (Personal; His internship as a tattoo artist began with this tattoo) 

My own recommendations Item 1: Weighted Blanket (It helps me sleep easier and quicker. I toss and turn a lot when sleeping and this feels like a hug and just keeps me from turning so much.) 
Item 2: Whiteboard/ Pre-cut Paper (I am an eccentric thinker and this helps me jot down any ideas or thoughts I want to come back to while I concentrate on something else. Handy if you have a chaotic brain and want some order.)
