white paper gog

stepico interaction between immutable


Resources
Consumables
Permanent Items or Objects
Quest/Mission Objectives

Fixed economic systems -  come from within the game itself
Player-dynamic economic system - player can affect the value of goods
F2P economic systems - incentivizes the player to pay
Prestige economic systems - cosmetics etc
Real currency economic systems

mechanics of economic systems
- resource generation
- resource conversion - crafting
- resource trading - with other players
- resource consumption
- resource limits

Supply and demand
supply curve - minimum sell

finite and infinite resources

demand curve - maximum buy

margin - last resource bought or sold 

Margin is important in F2P - the more the player has, the more they are willing to pay provided they are close to their goal


supply and demand with multiple resources
**imperfect substitutes** - 50 hp potion is similar to 5 mp spell that heals 50 hp

several goods can be **complements** demand for both goes up or down together

**market price** is where supply and demand curves intersect

designer effect the market and trading price by
- controlling availability
- controlling rarity of drops
- controlling placement of stores
- controlling the property of the items

targeting the market
getting as many players into the **funnel**
players are ramped out by increasing game difficulty

old adage - you can always lower prices but not raise them

inflation

supply-side inflation
gold farmers make an dramatic oversupply of gold
needed to raise prices or create money sinks

demand-side inflation
demand changes can change when there is
- a game balance change
- new content introduced
- a new strategy or exploit discovered

positive sum economy creates inflation

negative sum element

measure the average gold per player and see if it is growing or shrinking over time

open and closed economies

balancing open economies 
- limiting spending
- limiting power
- proving competitive gates (ELO)
- survival of the richest - pay to win, pay to rush
