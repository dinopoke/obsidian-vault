Based off a co-op game called [[Pandemic]] where you travel around the world to try and stop diseases from spreading. This version is a Legacy game which means there’s a campaign and as you progress, you make permanent changes to the board game such as writing on cards, opening up new packs, ripping up cards and putting stickers on things. Story based so it’s one of the few games where there are spoilers.
