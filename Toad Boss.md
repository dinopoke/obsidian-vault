### Blue's Notes

toad: - jumping - tongue attack - pulls you closer - attack bum refight: poison spores, etc Armored butt version, weasely ver, angry ver rider: - lance - whip - big pipe ! - tongue stays out grab one char + take other character to hit tongue - toad with damage -> hind legs rider falls off - rider falls off = bounces a couple of tiles away from toad - turning for toad = 1 movement - can't hit when behind (enemy) #?!@#$ - kill toad = rider gets angry (taunt) - Kill rider = battle shortcut

### Kristian's Notes
1.    
    ### MOVEMENT ### - Toad is slow. Only has X (2 or so?) hops per turn. - Facing direction matters, so turning around takes one of their hops. - For now, only left and right facing. - If possible in future, facing up and down too? - Or just keep it left and right, to avoid visibility issues, and reduce work?  
    - Standing behind him means he cant attack you (*see refight variations) - Unless maybe he hops backwards on top of you? - The Rider can't swing at you either, so he'll just glare at you and angrily wave his hand in the air, yelling "!?#@!"  
    - Standing parallel (up or down 1-2 tiles?) to him means the rider can whack you  
    - Standing infront of him, the Rider can jab his weapon ahead and hit you. - The Toad might also use lick attacks on you.

    ### SPECIAL ATTACKS ### - Toad uses his tonuge to pull your characters closer, and the rider follows up with a melee attack  
    - Toad uses his tongue to wrap one of your player characters, binding them for a turn. - If the other character attacks the extended tongue, it frees them and makes the toad real up on its hind legs in pain - If the rider is unstable, he'll fall off at this point, else he holds on. - Failing to attack the tongue and free them from the wrap, the toad eats them and deals damage, before spitting them out for extra damage  
    - Rider has a 2 range weapon of some sort, a metal pipe / shoddily crafted scavenger spear?  
    - Rider also can throw bombs of some sort? - Needs a cue or predicatble reason to do so though, IE if players are standing in a group?

    ### SEPARATING THE RIDER ### - Rider can use a choreographed charge up attack, swinging his weapon in a wide arc - which leaves him noticably unstable for a turn or so - In this state, he can be knocked off, such as via the prior mentioned hitting the toads tongue attack  
    - Upon falling off, the Rider bounces / rolls 3-5 tiles or so away, intentionally making a gap between the Rider and the Toad - Rider is stunned for a period, to let you wail on him for a bit - Afterwards, he tries to make it back to his Toad, where you can stand in the way and engage him in combat (*See refight variants)
    
4.  _[_2:05 PM_]_
    
    ### PLAYER TACTICS ### - The Toad may have a lot of health, but killing it leaves the Rider vulnerable and unable to get back on the Toad - If you kill the Toad when the Rider is on him, he falls off, maybe being stunned for a turn as he can't get to his feet? - The Rider could get angry that you killed his Toad, and enter an enranged / panicked state  
    - If you separate the Rider from the Toad, and kill the Rider, the Toad won't bother fighting back, and will just leave. (*see refight variations)  
    - There's a choice in strategies: - Try to focus the Toad so the Rider cant get back on and is left alone? - Or try to focus the Rider, taking damage from both targets, but potentially ending the fight earlier? - Let the Rider get back to his Toad, where he wont really attack you unless you stand in his way - Or intercept the Rider so he cant get back to his Toad, but he will attack you in return
    
5.  _[_2:05 PM_]_
    
    ### REFIGHT VARIATIONS ### - A posion Toad that spews poison, covering some of the tiles infront of him in poison, which could affect the players tactics - Tongue and eat attacks would probably also be buffed to inflict poison, getting eaten especially.  
    - An armoured Toad, that has a armoured behind, s either cant take damage from behind, or is greatly reduced. - This reduces the chance of killing the toad on its own, without knocking off the Rider.  
    - Giving the Rider a different weapon - A gun / ranged weapon?  
    - A cowardly Rookie Rider vs a Trained Confident Rider - Affects how they act when knocked off the Toad: - Type A: Cowardly means he'll try to avoid confronting the player, and try to circle around to quickly get back to their Toad ASAP, where they feel safe. - Type B: Confident means they'll try to barrel through the player, to get to their Toad, attacking the player if they're in the way - Type C: Maybe even another variant of Rider, who intentionally gets off his Toad, and goes in for the fight, not even bothering to get to their toad (maybe only after a couple of turns of combat) - Would be cool if they had combo attacks with their Toad partner  
    - A well trained Toad that continues to fight even after his Rider dies?
