A risk roadmap is a roadmap (high level project plan visualisation) youâ€™re creating specifically to assess major unknowns and potential threats to your project success. The goal in creating a Risk Roadmap is to visualise all of the information you have about your plan (the work, how your team feels about the work, the knowns and unknowns, project constraints) to develop mitigation plans both within your team, and with your stakeholders.
